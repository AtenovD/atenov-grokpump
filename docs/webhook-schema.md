# Signal webhook schema

PumpGuard sends one HTTP `POST` with `Content-Type: application/json` to every URL in `WEBHOOK_URLS` whenever a token passes the complete pipeline and a dry-run position is opened. Webhook delivery does not depend on `ALERT_CHAT_ID`. A timeout, connection error, or non-2xx response is retried once after 500 ms; failure of one endpoint does not stop delivery to the others or roll back the simulated position.

Consumers must branch on `schema_version`. Version 1 has this exact envelope:

  }
}
```

`emitted_at` and `token.created_at` are Unix seconds in UTC. Nullable token fields (`symbol`, `name`, `creator`, `unique_buyers`, and `reference_price`) can be JSON `null`. On a passing signal all five verdict objects and `risk` are present; the object shapes mirror the dataclasses in `bot/services/models.py`. New optional fields may be added within version 1, but existing fields and meanings will not be removed or changed without incrementing `schema_version`.

Endpoints should return any 2xx status quickly and process asynchronously. Delivery is at-least-once because a successful request whose response is lost can be retried; use a combination of `event`, `emitted_at`, `analysis.token.chain`, and `analysis.token.mint` for deduplication.
